A W.I.P. revamp of our website, by us and contributing members from our Discord.
===

### Add anything you think we need to do to the TODO list.
### Do we want it to be a single-html-file thing, where a JS script similar to the one from [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/TheDragonRing/3b59e23f5d455851940586e22aef892c) manages which page appears, or a file per page, like in the previous site?
### Do we want to design a new icon for the BoxOfDevs Team?
